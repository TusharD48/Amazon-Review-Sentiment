# Introduction
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative, or neutral. By analyzing reviews, businesses can understand customer satisfaction and improve their products and services.

# Introduction
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative, or neutral. By analyzing reviews, businesses can understand customer satisfaction and improve their products and services.

# Model and Technique
This project utilizes several machine learning techniques and models to perform sentiment analysis:

- NLP Model: A model specifically designed for natural language processing tasks. This could be a simple TF-IDF vectorizer combined with a classifier or a more complex deep learning model like BERT.
- Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees.
- XGBoost: An optimized gradient boosting algorithm designed for speed and performance.
- Grid Search CV: A technique to perform hyperparameter tuning by searching through a manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space.
- K-Fold Cross Validation: A resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample
